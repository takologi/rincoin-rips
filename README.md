# Rincoin Improvement Proposals (RIPs)

This repository contains the formal Rincoin Improvement Proposals (RIPs). RIPs describe consensus rules, processes, and best practices for the Rincoin protocol.

The RIP process itself is defined in [RIP-0001](rip-0001/rip-0001.md).

## Bootstrap status (read this first)

This repository is in a **bootstrap phase**. Specifically:

- The RIP process described in RIP-0001 was published without a prior public discussion period. RIP-0001 is itself in `Draft` and is subject to revision.
- No public discussion venue ("Discussion-To") is yet operational. Preambles list `TBD` accordingly.
- The set of editors is bootstrapped at two: the original author of these documents and one independent editor (see [`governance/editor-changes.md`](governance/editor-changes.md)). Further editors will be appointed per RIP-0001 §Editors.
- Almost every Standards Track RIP in this repository was authored unilaterally and has not yet undergone substantive editor or community review. Such RIPs are marked `Idea` (a pre-`Draft` state defined in RIP-0001 §RIP Status). Do not interpret their presence here as endorsement by Rincoin's user community.

Until that changes, RIPs in this repository should be read as **proposals from their respective authors**, not as ratified protocol policy.

## Activation Timeline

RIPs activate at the following block heights (mainnet, 60 s/block):

| Block Height | Approx. Year | RIP(s) Activating | Status | Mechanism |
|--------------|--------------|-------------------|--------|-----------|
| 0 (genesis) | 0 | RIP-0002 | ✅ Active | Embedded in chainparams from genesis (Core v1.0.6) |
| **— (mainnet `NEVER_ACTIVE`)** | — | RIP-0004 (MWEB) | **Suspended** | Sealed via BIP9 NEVER_ACTIVE; reactivation requires successor RIP |
| 840 (testnet/regtest) | — | RIP-0004 (MWEB) | Active on testnet/regtest | Soft-fork activation for validation purposes |
| 840,000 | ~1.60 | RIP-0002 CH activation boundary, RIP-0009 (RIN3), RIP-0010 (Dynamic Subsidy Scaling) | ⏳ Pending | Single hard-fork flag day |
| 5,250,000–6,260,000 | ~10–12 | RIP-0003 (CSV) — signaling window | ⏳ Pending | BIP9-style with objective gating, bit 1, threshold 90% |
| 6,300,000 | ~12 | RIP-0002 terminal phase entry / RIP-0003 (if activated) | ⏳ Pending | Automatic |
| 15,768,000 | ~30 | RIP-0007, RIP-0008 | ⏳ Pending | Time-deterministic hard fork |
| ~233,280,000 | ~444 | RIP-0005, RIP-0006 (full activation) | ⏳ Pending | Time-deterministic hard fork at PoR |

Current chain progress: see [Rincoin Core](https://github.com/Rin-coin/rincoin) repository.

RIP-0001 is `Active` as the governing process specification. RIP-0002 (Customized Halving) is `Active`: the schedule has been enforced from genesis on the Rincoin mainchain via Core v1.0.6, with Phase 0→1 and Phase 1→2 boundaries validated in production. RIP-0003, RIP-0005 through RIP-0008, and RIP-0009 through RIP-0010 are `Draft`. Reference implementations exist in [`rincoin-sim`](https://github.com/Aevust/rincoin-sim) and [Rincoin Core](https://github.com/Rin-coin/rincoin) for RIP-0002 and RIP-0004; the reference implementation for RIP-0009 and RIP-0010 is in progress (Core v1.0.7 pre-release, definitive in v1.1.0). Reference implementations for RIP-0003 and RIP-0005 through RIP-0008 are pending.

**Note on the Block 840,000 hard fork**: RIP-0002 (CH dilation), RIP-0009 (RIN3 transaction-version replay protection), and RIP-0010 (Dynamic Subsidy Scaling implementation) are co-activated as a single, well-announced hard-fork event at Block 840,000. Consolidating these consensus changes into one flag day minimizes operational disruption for node operators and mining pools. The minimum-peer-version floor (PROTOCOL_VERSION 70018) is tracked separately as a v1.1.0 networking change activating at the same height.

**Note on RIP-0004 (MWEB)**: While the specification is implemented in Core v1.0.6 and validated in `rincoin-sim`, the mainnet activation has been suspended via BIP9 `NEVER_ACTIVE` per a strategic decision of the Rincoin Core Authority. The suspension is documented in §2.1 of RIP-0004. Testnet and regtest activation at block 840 remains in effect for validation purposes. Any future reactivation requires a successor RIP per the conditions outlined in RIP-0004.

## Core Role Governance

The Core Strategic Authority (Core Technical Lead, Core Authority Lead, Core Research Lead, Principal Architect), version-numbering scheme (`v[GENERATION].[MAJOR].[MINOR]`), and succession procedure are defined in [RIP-0001](rip-0001/rip-0001.md). Current role assignments are maintained in [`governance/core-role.md`](governance/core-role.md).
